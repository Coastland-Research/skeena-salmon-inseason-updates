# Summary

-   Pre-season forecasts

    -   The pre-season forecast for the Total Return of Skeena sockeye in 2025 ranges from 1.3 to 5.8 million (90% confidence range) with a point estimate (p50) of 2.7 million.
    -   On average, Alaskan fisheries take approximately 5-10% of the aggregate sockeye run.
    -   The pre-season forecast for the terminal run of Skeena Chinook point estimate is 26,615 with a 50% confidence interval of 16,683 (p25) to 34,747 (p75).

-   Tyee Test Fishery

    -   The Tyee test fishery started operations on June 10.
    -   Moving towards larger tides which may improve fish movement.
    -   Sockeye escapement estimates are tracking just below the median of returns from 1970-2024, with the TRTC model estimate stabilising over the last 2 weeks while decreasing slightly to around 1.65M on average timing (1.69M if one week late, and 1.63M if one week early), but still well below the pre-season forecast for early and average run-timing projections.
    -   If average run-timing, \~ 98% of the run has passed Tyee to date.
    -   The Chinook index index is tracking between the 25th and 50th percentiles of all years to date. Compared to recent years (2011 on), the Chinook index is looking quite good tracking between the 50th and 75th percentiles.
    -   Pink salmon were tracking off the charts well above the highest run index ever. Supporting information from Area 3 and other fisheries indicates a very large pink return this year, however decreasing index values may indicate a very early pink run this year.
    -   Chum and coho are tracking around the long-term median to date.
    -   Steelhead started fairly stong, but are now tracking jsut below the long-term median.

-   Babine

    -   The Babine fence typically started operations on July 14.
    -   Large sockeye are tracking around the 75th percentile to date.
    -   In comparison to Tyee, the Babine fence is showing less sockeye so far than expected, which could be a result of a Tyee overestimate, longer than expected migration between Tyee and the Babine fence, or a grearter proportion of non-Babine sockeye than 10% this year.
    -   Jack sockeye, which predict 4-yr old sockeye returns next year, are tracking right around the long-term median.
    -   Pink salmon have also started showing up at the Babine fence, and are also indicating an early return there.

-   Kitwanga Fence

    -   The Kitwanga fence typically started operations on July 11. Information from the Kitwanga fence is shared weekly by Gitanyow Fisheries Authority.

-   First Nations Food Fisheries

    -   First Nations food fisheries are ongoing on the coast and marine approach waters, and in-river.

-   Commercial Fisheries

    -   Commercial fisheries targetting sockeye in Area 4 started on July 12 and the last commercial opportunity was August 4-7 for seines, and August 8 for gillnets.
    -   First Nations demonstration fisheries targeting sockeye in Area 4 opened on July 9 for Lax Kw'alaams, Metlakatla and NCSFNSS.
    -   In-river demo fisheries are ongoing, with openings for Kitsumkalum, Kitselas, and Gitksan to date.
    -   Catch information for demo fisheries has been updated and will be updated with preliminary information as it comes in.

-   Recreational Fisheries

    -   Recreational fisheries for sockeye have opened following the IFMP and the commercial opening for sockeye.
    -   Early recreational fisheries for Chinook occurred in Areas 3/4 however effort was lower in 2025 than in previous years, bag limits were reduced, and as of June 22 there was non-retention of Chinook in the Area 3&4 fishery.
    -   Retention of Chinook in Areas 3-5 resumed July 24 with a daily limit of 1 per day.

-   Appendix A shows the daily and cumulative run-timing of Tyee since 2000 versus 2024.

-   Appendix B will include information on the other species caught in the Area 4 commercial fishery and CPUEs and will be updated once fisheries begin.

-   Appendix C includes information on run-timing of specific Skeena Conservation Units/stocks.

# Tyee Test Fishery

The section below shows index data (and escapement data for sockeye) from 2025 compared to historical index values through Tyee. Data is uploaded from the DFO Tyee test fishery website (index and expanded estimates) almost daily.

The DFO Tyee test fishery website can be found here: [Tyee test fishery website](https://www.pac.dfo-mpo.gc.ca/fm-gp/northcoast-cotenord/skeenatyee-eng.html)

## Sockeye Salmon

### Sockeye index

The 2025 sockeye index is shown below and compared to historical index data from the Tyee test fishery (@fig-index-sockeye).

```{r,fig.height=7,fig.cap="Daily (top) and cumulative (bottom) index values for sockeye salmon from 1956-2024 (grey lines). 2025 values are shown in purple, and various percentiles are shown by the grey dashed lines."}
#| label: fig-index-sockeye

  select(Date,"2025"=sockeye)

make.index.figures(daily,current,150,5000,figures.x.date)

```

### Escapement estimates at Tyee

Escapement estimates for sockeye are generated using the Tyee index and a catchability coefficient based on the average of the last 3 years catchability.

The 2025 sockeye escapement estimate at Tyee is shown below and compared to historical escapement data (not including catch as we do not have the historical daily escapement estimate plus catch) (@fig-escapement-sockeye)

```{r,fig.height=7,fig.cap="Daily (top) and cumulative (bottom) escapement estimates at Tyee for sockeye salmon from 1970-2024 (grey lines). 2025 values are shown in purple, and various percentiles are shown by the grey dashed lines."}

ggarrange(p1,p2,ncol=1,align="v",common.legend = TRUE,legend="bottom")

```

### In-season abundance estimate

Sockeye in-season abundance (TRTC) is estimated through the Tyee test fishery using the cumulative run-to Tyee (escapement past Tyee plus adjusted marine catch estimates) and run-timing. The following table (@tbl-trtc-outputs) and figure (@fig-sx-trtc-model) show estimates of the final forecasted TRTC for average, one-week late, and one-week early run-timing. This does not incorporate variability in the catchability of the Tyee test fishery (which is confirmed post-season).

```{r}
source("scripts/plot_sx_trtc_model.R")
source("scripts/tyee_sockeye_trtc_model.R")
```

```{r}
#| label: tbl-trtc-outputs

#| label: fig-sx-cum-prop

make.prop.figure(gg.daily.pcum, data2)
```

## Chinook Salmon

The 2025 Chinook salmon index is shown below and compared to historical index data from the Tyee test fishery (@fig-index-chinook) in the text.

```{r,fig.height=7,fig.cap="Daily (top) and cumulative (bottom) index values for Chinook salmon from 1956-2024 (grey lines). 2025 values are shown in purple, and various percentiles are shown by the grey dashed lines."}

  select(Date,"2025"=chinook)

make.index.figures(daily,current,20,400,figures.x.date)
```

For comparison, the following figures show the Chinook index compared to more recent years since Chinook abundance declined to much lower levels. In comparison to the previous figures showing Chinook abundance since 1956, the Chinook index in 2025 is looking relatively optimistic.

```{r,fig.height=7,fig.cap="Daily (top) and cumulative (bottom) index values for Chinook salmon from 2011-2024 (grey lines). 2025 values are shown in purple, and various percentiles are shown by the grey dashed lines."}

### Babine comparison with Tyee

This comparison aims to provide a coarse idea on the catchability at Tyee. The red line in the figure below shows the difference between the escapement past Tyee and the total run being counted at the Babine Fence, based on some assumptions. These assumptions include 3 week migration timing, 10% non-Babine stock composition and a rough estimate of in-river FSC and demo harvest to date between Tyee and Babine.

### First Nations Demonstration and Economic Opportunity

First Nations CSAF demonstration fisheries opened on July 9 in 2025. The catch associated with each demonstration fishery is determined using the weekly TAC. In 2025, the CTAC approach is being implemented, which means that the catch allocation of the demonstration fishery is no longer directly linked to what the commercial marine fishery catches each week. Catch by Nation/Nation group and gear type are shown below.

## Recreational Fisheries

The following table shows the updated management guidelines for recreational fisheries targeting sockeye in the Skeena watershed as per the 2025-26 North Coast Salmon IFMP. For the 2025 season, the recreational fishery for Skeena Sockeye will open when the estimated Total Return to Canada threshold of 1.05 million Sockeye has been achieved and commercial fisheries are triggered.

# Appendix B - Catch of pink, chum, coho, chinook and steelhead

# Appendix C - Population specific run-timing through Tyee

Notes:

-   Based on NBRR update data (2000-2014) provided by Karl English July 2022. Will add in the newer data and some comparisons.

-   These are average run-timings.

-   Explorations on the differences between the average and ANNUAL run-timing standard deviations are underway for stocks with appropriate sample size.
