# Summary

-   Pre-season forecasts

    -   The pre-season forecast for the Total Return of Skeena sockeye in 2025 ranges from 1.3 to 5.8 million (90% confidence range) with a point estimate (p50) of 2.7 million.
    -   On average, Alaskan fisheries take approximately 5-10% of the aggregate sockeye run.
    -   The pre-season forecast for the terminal run of Skeena Chinook point estimate is 26,615 with a 50% confidence interval of 16,683 (p25) to 34,747 (p75).

-   Tyee Test Fishery

    -   The Tyee test fishery started operations on June 10.
    -   Sockeye escapement estimates are tracking just above the median of returns from 1970-2024, with the TRTC model estimate increasing over the last few days, but still well below the pre-season forecast for early and average run-timing projections.
    -   Chinook are also being caught at Tyee, with the cumulative index increasing to between the 25th and 50th percentiles to date. Compared to recent years (2011 on), the Chinook index is looking quite good.
    -   Few pink, coho, chum, or steelhead have been caught at Tyee yet, however supporting information indicates that some coho have been caught in FSC fisheries.

-   Babine

    -   The Babine fence typically starts operations in mid-July. This section will be updated once Babine counts start.

    -   Babine vs Tyee comparison will be added when fence operations start.

    -   Babine jack sockeye to be updated soon!

    -   Babine other salmon to be updated soon!

-   Kitwanga Fence

    -   The Kitwanga fence typically starts operations by July 10. Information from the Kitwanga fence is shared weekly by Gitanyow Fisheries Authority.

-   First Nations Food Fisheries

    -   First Nations food fisheries have started on the coast and marine approach waters, and in-river.
    -   Indications suggest that fishing in-river has been slow so far.

-   Commercial Fisheries

    -   Commercial fisheries in Area 4 targeting sockeye have not started yet, but are anticipated given the pre-season sockeye forecast.
    -   Commercial fisheries targeting sockeye will open in Area 3 on July 2 and 3.

-   Recreational Fisheries

    -   Recreational fisheries for sockeye have not started, but will begin once the in-season forecast exceeds 1.05M and commercial fishery openings are triggered in Area 4.
    -   Early recreational fisheries for Chinook occurred in Areas 3/4 however effort was lower in 2025 than in previous years, bag limits were reduced, and as of June 22 there is non-retention of Chinook in the Area 3&4 fishery.

-   Appendix A shows the daily and cumulative run-timing of Tyee since 2000 versus 2024.

-   Appendix B will include information on the other species caught in the Area 4 commercial fishery and CPUEs and will be updated once fisheries begin.

-   Appendix C includes information on run-timing of specific Skeena Conservation Units/stocks.

# Pre-Season Forecasts

## Chinook

The pre-season forecast for Chinook is \~ 26,600 large Chinook.

The table below shows the total 2025 Skeena Chinook terminal run point forecast (highlighted in yellow) and forecasted returns by age. Age-specific forecasts are obtained using ForecastR, which uses a model selection and ranking approach and retrospective forecast performance.

# Tyee Test Fishery-Index and Escapement Estimates

The section below shows index data (and escapement data for sockeye) from 2025 compared to historical index values through Tyee. Data is uploaded from the DFO Tyee test fishery website (index and expanded estimates) almost daily.

The DFO Tyee test fishery website can be found here: [Tyee test fishery website](https://www.pac.dfo-mpo.gc.ca/fm-gp/northcoast-cotenord/skeenatyee-eng.html)

## Sockeye Salmon

### Sockeye index

The 2025 sockeye index is shown below and compared to historical index data from the Tyee test fishery (@fig-index-sockeye).

```{r,fig.height=7,fig.cap="Daily (top) and cumulative (bottom) index values for sockeye salmon from 1956-2024 (grey lines). 2025 values are shown in purple, and various percentiles are shown by the grey dashed lines."}
#| label: fig-index-sockeye

daily<-fread("data/common/tyee_daily_indices_sockeye_1956-2024.csv")

current<-fread("data/current_year/tyee data 2025.csv") %>%
  select(Date,"2025"=sockeye)

make.index.figures(daily,current,50,600,figures.x.date)

```

### Escapement estimates at Tyee

Escapement estimates for sockeye are generated using the Tyee index and a catchability coefficient based on the average of the last 3 years catchability.

The 2025 sockeye escapement estimate at Tyee is shown below and compared to historical escapement data (not including catch as we do not have the historical daily escapement estimate plus catch) (@fig-escapement-sockeye)

```{r,fig.height=7,fig.cap="Daily (top) and cumulative (bottom) escapement estimates at Tyee for sockeye salmon from 1970-2024 (grey lines). 2025 values are shown in purple, and various percentiles are shown by the grey dashed lines."}

ggarrange(p1,p2,ncol=1,align="v",common.legend = TRUE,legend="bottom")

```

### In-season abundance estimate

Sockeye in-season abundance (TRTC) is estimated through the Tyee test fishery using the cumulative run-to Tyee (escapement past Tyee plus adjusted marine catch estimates) and run-timing. The following table (@tbl-trtc-outputs) and figure (@fig-sx-trtc-model) show estimates of the final forecasted TRTC for average, one-week late, and one-week early run-timing. This does not incorporate variability in the catchability of the Tyee test fishery (which is confirmed post-season).

```{r}

source("scripts/tyee_sockeye_trtc_model.R")
```

```

```{r, fig.height=5,fig.cap="Final estimated TRTC from the simple sockeye in-season abundance estimator for early (green line), average (red line) and late (blue line) run-timing. The dashed line shows the pre-season forecast of a TRTC of ~2.4 million."}

## Chinook Salmon

The 2025 Chinook salmon index is shown below and compared to historical index data from the Tyee test fishery (@fig-index-chinook) in the text.

```{r,fig.height=7,fig.cap="Daily (top) and cumulative (bottom) index values for Chinook salmon from 1956-2024 (grey lines). 2025 values are shown in purple, and various percentiles are shown by the grey dashed lines."}

  select(Date,"2025"=chinook)

make.index.figures(daily,current,20,300,figures.x.date)
```

For comparison, the following figures show the Chinook index compared to more recent years since Chinook abundance declined to much lower levels. In comparison to the previous figures showing Chinook abundance since 1956, the Chinook index in 2025 is looking realtively optimistic.

```{r,fig.height=7,fig.cap="Daily (top) and cumulative (bottom) index values for Chinook salmon from 2011-2024 (grey lines). 2025 values are shown in purple, and various percentiles are shown by the grey dashed lines."}

ggarrange(p1,p2,ncol=1,common.legend = TRUE,legend="bottom")  

```

## Chum Salmon

The 2025 chum salmon index is shown below and compared to historical index data from the Tyee test fishery (@fig-index-chum).

The following table shows the updated management guidelines for recreational fisheries targeting sockeye in the Skeena watershed as per the 2025-26 North Coast Salmon IFMP. For the 2025 season, the recreational fishery for Skeena Sockeye will open when the estimated Total Return to Canada threshold of 1.05 million Sockeye has been achieved and commercial fisheries are triggered.
