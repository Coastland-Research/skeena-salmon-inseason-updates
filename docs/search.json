    "text": "The pre-season forecast for the Total Return of Skeena sockeye in 2024 ranges from 0.58 to 4.0 million (90% confidence range) with a point estimate (p50) of 1.54 million.\nThe forecast for 2024 includes a low return of age-4 sockeye, and an average return of age-5 sockeye.\nThe Tyee test fishery started on June 10.\nTo date 340,842 sockeye are estimated to have passed by Tyee, with about 16.1% of the run through to date on average (6.8% if 1-week late, 31.7% if one week early). Sockeye escapement has picked up over the last week and is continuing to be variable (Figures 1-5).\nWe are getting closer to the mid-point of the run, but at ~15% on average timing, it is still very early to make predictions on the final TRTC, however, the excel model is increasing for all 3 run-timings, suggesting that the run may be coming in later than average. The current run size prediction is 2.1M on average run-timing (4.4M if one week late and 1.2M if 1 week early) (Figure 6). The next couple of weeks as we move towards the midpoint of the run will be important.\nWe are currently moving towards smaller tides which may influence the migration of salmon into the Skeena River (Tides section)\nThe Babine fence started operations July 9, with no salmon through to date.\nThe Kitwanga fence started operations last week, with counts starting as of July 10.\nIf sockeye return at the pre-season forecasted abundance, a small commercial fishery will be able to be prosecuted (Area C gillnets, Area A seines, and First Nations demos). According to DFO, there are no commercial fisheries currently being planned (e.g. no opening dates yet).\nAppendix A will include information on the other species caught in the Area 4 commercial fishery and CPUEs when available.\nAppendix B includes information on run-timing of specific Skeena Conservation Units/stocks.",

    "text": "Tyee Escapement and TRTC\nThe section below shows various summaries of the sockeye run through Tyee to date, often in comparison with historical data.

The 2024 run estimates are shown by the coloured lines. Each line represents the proportion through based on a final season estimate shown in the legend. For example, the red line is based on a final TRTC of 1.5M, with the line showing the cumulative number of sockeye through on each date / 1.5M. Until we have the true final TRTC, we will not be able to calculate the true cumulative proportion. This is done to give an idea of run-timing and whether the pre-season forecast is likely to be close to the in-season estimate. The blue dashed line indicates the long-term average 50% through date.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe following figure shows the daily run estimated at the Tyee test fishery for the last 5 years. This figure shows how the run in 2024 compares with recent years in terms of the Tyee daily estimates (note this does not include catch estimates in the marine commercial or Section 35(1) fisheries). These estimates are raw data from Tyee and therefore not corrected for catchability.\nCurrently, daily run estimates are tracking close to the last 2 years, and considerably higher than 2020 and 2021.

    "text": "In-Season TRTC Estimates\nThis section shows the estimated final TRTC as predicted by the simple run-timing proportion Excel based spreadsheet tool. Accuracy of this model increases as the season progresses since run-timing uncertainty is large at the start of the year, and small at the end of the year. Catchability (how many sockeye each sockeye caught in the Tyee test fishery represents), the other component of the uncertainty in this model, is unknown until after the final TRTC accounting has been completed in the post-season. Tyee estimates typically have a range of +/- 20% from the true TRTC, with some years being greater than 20% error, and many years being less than 20% error.
