    "text": "Summary\n\nThe pre-season forecast for the Total Return of Skeena sockeye in 2024 ranges from 0.58 to 4.0 million (90% confidence range) with a point estimate (p50) of 1.54 million.\nThe forecast for 2024 includes a low return of age-4 sockeye, and an average return of age-5 sockeye.\nThe Tyee test fishery started on June 10.\nTo date 69,236 sockeye are estimated to have passed by Tyee, with about 5.2% of the run through to date on average (2.0% if 1-week late, 12.7% if one week early).\nIt is still too early to use the run timing to predict a final 2024 return of sockeye, however the 2024 return is tracking similar to 2021, below average, but with a bump up to larger daily runs over the long weekend and yesterday (Figures 1-4).\nIf sockeye return at the pre-season forecasted abundance, a small commercial fishery will be able to be prosecuted (Area C gillnets, Area A seines, and First Nations demos).\nAppendix A will include information on the other species caught in the Area 4 commercial fishery and CPUEs when available.\nAppendix B includes information on run-timing of specific Skeena Conservation Units/stocks.\n\n\n\nTyee Escapement and TRTC\n\nCumulative escapement, TRTC, and catch to July 2.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCumulative.to.Date\nNumber.of.Sockeye\nRun.Timing\nPercent.Through\n\n\n\n\nEscapement Past Tyee\n69236\nAverage\n5.2\n\n\nTRTC (Escapement+Catch)\n69236\nOne week early\n12.7\n\n\nCatch (preliminary)\n0\nOne week late\n2.0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Daily (top) and cumulative (bottom) estimated escapement and TRTC (escapement + adjusted catch) at the Tyee test fishery versus the 1985-2023 average.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2: Daily run through Tyee (uncorrected) from 1970-2023. 2024 run is shown in purple.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3: Daily cumulative proportion of the sockeye run through Tyee (uncorrected) from 1970-2023. The 2024 run estiamtes are shown by the coloured lines. Each line represents the proportion through based on a final season estimate shown in the legend. For example, the red line is based on a final TRTC of 1.5M, with the line showing the cumulative number of sockeye through on each date / 1.5M. Until we have the true final TRTC, we will not be able to calculate the true cumulative proportion. This is done to give an idea of run-timing and whether the pre-season forecast is likely to be close to the in-season estimate. The blue dashed line indicates the long-term average 50% through date.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4: Daily run through Tyee (uncorrected) since 2020. 2024 run is shown in purple.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn-Season TRTC Estimates\nThis section shows the estimated final TRTC as predicted by the simple run-timing proportion Excel based spreadsheet tool. Accuracy of this model increases as the season progresses since run-timing uncertainty is large at the start of the year, and small at the end of the year. Catchability (how many sockeye each sockeye caught in the Tyee test fishery represents), the other component of the uncertainty in this model, is unknown until after the final TRTC accounting has been completed in the post-season. Tyee estimates typically have a range of +/- 20% from the true TRTC, with some years being greater than 20% error, and many years being less than 20% error. The 2024 catchability is based on an average of the last 3 years.\n\nForecasted sockeye final TRTC based on 1 week early, average and 1 week late run-timing.\n\n\nRun.Timing\nForecasted.Final.Run.Size\n\n\n\n\nEarly\n614711\n\n\nAverage\n1334097\n\n\nLate\n2932546\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 5: Forecasted final TRTC of Skeena sockeye based on the simple scalar run-timing model.
