    "text": "The pre-season forecast for the Total Return of Skeena sockeye in 2024 ranges from 0.58 to 4.0 million (90% confidence range) with a point estimate (p50) of 1.54 million.\nThe forecast for 2024 includes a low return of age-4 sockeye, and an average return of age-5 sockeye.\nThe Tyee test fishery started on June 10.\nWe are currently moving towards larger tides again which may influence the migration of salmon into the Skeena River (Tides section)\nTo date 530,085 sockeye are estimated to have passed by Tyee, with about 26.5% of the run through to date on average (12.7% if 1-week late, 46.2% if one week early). Sockeye escapement has picked up over the last week however is continuing to be variable (Figures 1-5).\nWe are getting closer to the mid-point of the run, but at ~25% on average timing, it is still early to make predictions on the final TRTC. The excel model was increasing for all 3 run-timings, however it has since stabilized, and is starting to decrease. The current run size prediction is 2.0M on average run-timing (3.7M if one week late and 1.2M if 1 week early) (Figure 6). The next week will be important as we move towards larger tides and towards the peak of the run, and will tell if we are tracking a 2022, 2023 or a something in between run.\nOther salmon species figures are in progress to show the 2024 Tyee daily index in comparison with historical index values.\nThe Babine fence started operations July 9, with 162 large sockeye through. The Babine section of the report will be updated in the next few days, along with the Babine-Tyee comparison.\nThe Kitwanga fence started operations last week, with counts starting as of July 10.\nCommercial fishing has started, with an Area C gillnet opening on July 13 - catch numbers will be updated shortly but preliminary sockeye catch is 7,173 pieces.\nAppendix A will include information on the other species caught in the Area 4 commercial fishery and CPUEs and will be updated shortly.\nAppendix B includes information on run-timing of specific Skeena Conservation Units/stocks.",

The 2024 run estimates are shown by the coloured lines. Each line represents the proportion through based on a final season estimate shown in the legend. For example, the red line is based on a final TRTC of 1.5M, with the line showing the cumulative number of sockeye through on each date / 1.5M. Until we have the true final TRTC, we will not be able to calculate the true cumulative proportion. This is done to give an idea of run-timing and whether the pre-season forecast is likely to be close to the in-season estimate. The blue dashed line indicates the long-term average 50% through date.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe following figure shows the daily run estimated at the Tyee test fishery for the last 5 years. This figure shows how the run in 2024 compares with recent years in terms of the Tyee daily estimates (note this does not include catch estimates in the marine commercial or Section 35(1) fisheries). These estimates are raw data from Tyee and therefore not corrected for catchability.\nCurrently, daily run estimates are tracking close to the last 2 years, and considerably higher than 2020 and 2021.

Accuracy of this model increases as the season progresses since run-timing uncertainty is large at the start of the year, and small at the end of the year. Catchability (how many sockeye each sockeye caught in the Tyee test fishery represents), the other component of the uncertainty in this model, is unknown until after the final TRTC accounting has been completed in the post-season. Tyee estimates typically have a range of +/- 20% from the true TRTC, with some years being greater than 20% error, and many years being less than 20% error. The 2024 catchability is based on an average of the last 3 years.\n\nForecasted sockeye final TRTC based on 1 week early, average and 1 week late run-timing.\n\n\nRun.Timing\nForecasted.Final.Run.Size\n\n\n\n\nEarly\n1227358\n\n\nAverage\n1998798\n\n\nLate\n3687570\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 6: Forecasted final TRTC of Skeena sockeye based on the simple scalar run-timing model.
