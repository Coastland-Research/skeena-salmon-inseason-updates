    "text": "Pre-season forecast\n\nThe pre-season forecast for the Total Return of Skeena sockeye in 2025 ranges from 1.3 to 5.8 million (90% confidence range) with a point estimate (p50) of 2.7 million\n\nTyee Test Fishery\n\nThe Tyee test fishery started operations on June 10.\nSockeye have started coming through, however it is too early to make any forecasts for the run size this year. Currently the escapement estimates are tracking just below the median of returns from 1970-2024.\nChinook are also being caught, and are tracking at a very low index value. Supporting information suggests low catch rates in FSC both in marine and in-river fisheries.\nNo pink, coho, chum, or steelhead have been caught at Tyee yet, however supporting information indicates that some coho have been caught in FSC fisheries.\n\nBabine\n\nThe Babine fence typically starts operations in mid-July. This section will be updated once Babine counts start.\nBabine vs Tyee comparison\nBabine jack sockeye\nBabine other salmon\n\nKitwanga Fence\n\nThe Kitwanga fence typically starts operations by July 10.\n\nFirst Nations Food Fisheries\n\nFirst Nations food fisheries have started on the coast and in the approach waters.\nIndications suggest that fishing in-river has been slow.\n\nCommercial Fisheries\n\nCommercial fisheries targetting sockeye have not started yet, but are anticipated given the pre-season sockeye forecast.\n\nRecreational Fisheries\n\nRecreational fisheries for sockeye have not started\nEarly recreational fisheries for Chinook occured in Areas 3/4 however effort was lower in 2025 than in previous years, bag limits were reduced, and as of June 22 there is non-retention of Chinook in the Area 3/4 fishery.\n\nAppendix A shows the daily and cumulative run-timing of Tyee since 2000 versus 2024.\nAppendix B will include information on the other species caught in the Area 4 commercial fishery and CPUEs and will be updated shortly.\nAppendix C includes information on run-timing of specific Skeena Conservation Units/stocks.",
