    "text": "Pre-season forecast\n\nThe pre-season forecast for the Total Return of Skeena sockeye in 2024 ranges from 0.58 to 4.0 million (90% confidence range) with a point estimate (p50) of 1.54 million. The forecast for 2024 includes a low return of age-4 sockeye, and an average return of age-5 sockeye.\n\nTyee Test Fishery\n\nTides influence the migration of salmon into the Skeena River. We are currently moving towards larger tides. (Tides section)\nTo date 554,994 sockeye are estimated to have passed by Tyee, with about 29.1% of the run through to date on average (14.4% if 1-week late, 49.1% if one week early). Sockeye escapement is not picking up for a large run and is continuing to be variable (Figures 1-5).\nAt ~30% on average timing, we are gaining a bit more confidence in predicting the final TRTC. The excel model was increasing for all 3 run-timings, however it stabilized briefly and now is decreasing significantly, especially in the late timing prediction. This may indicate a weaker mid-run and more average run-timing.\nThe current run size prediction is 1.9M on average run-timing (3.4M if one week late and 1.2M if 1 week early) (Figure 6). The next week will be important as we move towards larger tides and towards the peak of the run, and will tell if we are tracking a 2022, 2023 or a something in between run. We should be seeing daily runs of between 30,000 and 60,000 to keep pace with the 2023 return.\n\nBabine Sockeye\n\nThe Babine River fence started operations on July 9th. To date the total run is 556 large sockeye, with 0 sockeye jacks to date. More details will be added here shortly along with 2 forecast methods.\nThe Babine comparison with Tyee will be updated as more sockeye arrive at the Babine fence.\n\nTyee Other Species\n\nThe Chinook index remains very low and available evidence suggests a very low run.\nOnly a few chum salmon have started coming through Tyee.\nPink salmon are starting to come through with a stong start relative to even-year pink abundance.\nCoho salmon are just starting to come through Tyee.\nSteelhead are coming through Tyee and the index suggests a strong run to start, around the 90th percentile.\n\nBabine Fence\n\nThe Babine section of the report will be updated in the next few days, along with the Babine-Tyee comparison.\n\nKitwanga Fence\n\nThe Kitwanga fence started operations last week, with counts starting as of July 10.\n\nCommercial Fisheries\n\nCommercial fishing has started, with an Area C gillnet opening on July 13 - catch numbers will be updated shortly but preliminary sockeye catch is 7,173 pieces.\n\nAppendix A will include information on the other species caught in the Area 4 commercial fishery and CPUEs and will be updated shortly.\nAppendix B includes information on run-timing of specific Skeena Conservation Units/stocks.",

The 2024 run estimates are shown by the coloured lines. Each line represents the proportion through based on a final season estimate shown in the legend. For example, the red line is based on a final TRTC of 1.5M, with the line showing the cumulative number of sockeye through on each date / 1.5M. Until we have the true final TRTC, we will not be able to calculate the true cumulative proportion. This is done to give an idea of run-timing and whether the pre-season forecast is likely to be close to the in-season estimate. The blue dashed line indicates the long-term average 50% through date.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe following figure shows the daily run estimated at the Tyee test fishery for the last 5 years. This figure shows how the run in 2024 compares with recent years in terms of the Tyee daily estimates (note this does not include catch estimates in the marine commercial or Section 35(1) fisheries). These estimates are raw data from Tyee and therefore not corrected for catchability.\nCurrently, daily run estimates are tracking close to 2023, and considerably higher than 2020 and 2021.

Accuracy of this model increases as the season progresses since run-timing uncertainty is large at the start of the year, and small at the end of the year. Catchability (how many sockeye each sockeye caught in the Tyee test fishery represents), the other component of the uncertainty in this model, is unknown until after the final TRTC accounting has been completed in the post-season. Tyee estimates typically have a range of +/- 20% from the true TRTC, with some years being greater than 20% error, and many years being less than 20% error. The 2024 catchability is based on an average of the last 3 years.\n\nForecasted sockeye final TRTC based on 1 week early, average and 1 week late run-timing.\n\n\nRun.Timing\nForecasted.Final.Run.Size\n\n\n\n\nEarly\n1218092\n\n\nAverage\n1933486\n\n\nLate\n3485568\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 6: Forecasted final TRTC of Skeena sockeye based on the simple scalar run-timing model.
