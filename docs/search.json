    "text": "Pre-season forecast\n\nThe pre-season forecast for the Total Return of Skeena sockeye in 2024 ranges from 0.58 to 4.0 million (90% confidence range) with a point estimate (p50) of 1.54 million. The forecast for 2024 includes a low return of age-4 sockeye, and an average return of age-5 sockeye.\n\nTyee Test Fishery\n\nTides influence the migration of salmon into the Skeena River. We are currently at large tides for the next few days and hopefully will see that drive large numbers of fish in. (Tides section)\nTo date 1,165,520 sockeye are estimated to have passed by Tyee, with about 55% of the run through to date on average (35% if 1-week late, 74% if one week early). While sockeye escapement over the last week picked up considerably, we are right at the peak of the run on average run-timing, and there are good tides for sockeye migration (Figures 1-5). Including commercial catch and First Nations marine catches, the TRTC estimate around 1.2M (not including marine food fish and catch from the last few days).\nWe are at the midpoint of the run on average timing, and gaining more confidence in predicting the final TRTC. The excel model increased in early July stabilized briefly, decreased significantly, and stabilized again, and slightly increased with the last 3-4 days of large runs, and is now decreasing again. We are now tracking slightly greater than the 2023 run.\nThe current run size prediction is 2.2M on average run-timing (3.2M if one week late and 1.7M if 1 week early) (Figure 6). The next week will be important towards the peak of the run on average run timing, and will tell if we are tracking a 2022, 2023 or a something in between run. We should be seeing daily runs of aroudn 50-100k to keep pace with the 2023 return.\n\nBabine Sockeye\n\nThe Babine River fence started operations on July 9th. To July 25 the total run is 75,441 large sockeye, with 2,765 jack sockeye to date. More details will be added here shortly along with 2 forecast methods.\nThe Babine comparison with Tyee will be updated as more sockeye arrive at the Babine fence.\n\nTyee Other Species\n\nThe Chinook index remains very low and available evidence suggests a very low run and is tracking near the 10th percentile.\nOnly a few chum salmon have started coming through Tyee.\nPink salmon are starting to come through with a stong start relative to even-year pink abundance.\nCoho salmon are just starting to come through Tyee.\nSteelhead are coming through Tyee and the index suggests a strong run to start, around the 90th percentile.\n\nBabine Fence\n\nThe Babine section of the report will be updated in the next few days, along with the Babine-Tyee comparison.\n\nKitwanga Fence\n\nThe Kitwanga fence started operations July 10.\n\nCommercial Fisheries\n\nCommercial fishing has started, with an Area C gillnet openings on July 13, 20 and 21, and First Nations demonstration fisheries on July 16. Preliminary sockeye catch in the Area C gillnet openings is ~ 37,000. Preliminary demonstration fishery catches are ~ 2,000 sockeye.\n\nAppendix A will include information on the other species caught in the Area 4 commercial fishery and CPUEs and will be updated shortly.\nAppendix B includes information on run-timing of specific Skeena Conservation Units/stocks.",

The 2024 run estimates are shown by the coloured lines. Each line represents the proportion through based on a final season estimate shown in the legend. For example, the red line is based on a final TRTC of 1.5M, with the line showing the cumulative number of sockeye through on each date / 1.5M. Until we have the true final TRTC, we will not be able to calculate the true cumulative proportion. This is done to give an idea of run-timing and whether the pre-season forecast is likely to be close to the in-season estimate. The blue dashed line indicates the long-term average 50% through date.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe following figure shows the daily run estimated at the Tyee test fishery for the last 5 years. This figure shows how the run in 2024 compares with recent years in terms of the Tyee daily estimates (note this does not include catch estimates in the marine commercial or Section 35(1) fisheries). These estimates are raw data from Tyee and therefore not corrected for catchability.\nCurrently, daily run estimates are tracking close to 2023, and considerably higher than 2020 and 2021. See the next figure that shows the cumulative run through and the full season totals (unadjusted).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4: Daily run through Tyee (uncorrected) since 2020. 2024 run is shown in purple.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe following figure shows the cumulative daily run estimated at the Tyee test fishery for the last 5 years.

Accuracy of this model increases as the season progresses since run-timing uncertainty is large at the start of the year, and small at the end of the year. Catchability (how many sockeye each sockeye caught in the Tyee test fishery represents), the other component of the uncertainty in this model, is unknown until after the final TRTC accounting has been completed in the post-season. Tyee estimates typically have a range of +/- 20% from the true TRTC, with some years being greater than 20% error, and many years being less than 20% error. The 2024 catchability is based on an average of the last 3 years.\n\nForecasted sockeye final TRTC based on 1 week early, average and 1 week late run-timing.\n\n\nRun.Timing\nForecasted.Final.Run.Size\n\n\n\n\nEarly\n1680399\n\n\nAverage\n2181580\n\n\nLate\n3225107\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 6: Forecasted final TRTC of Skeena sockeye based on the simple scalar run-timing model.
