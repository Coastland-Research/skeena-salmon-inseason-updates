    "text": "Pre-season forecasts\n\nThe pre-season forecast for the Total Return of Skeena sockeye in 2025 ranges from 1.3 to 5.8 million (90% confidence range) with a point estimate (p50) of 2.7 million.\nOn average, Alaskan fisheries take approximately 5-10% of the aggregate sockeye run.\nThe pre-season forecast for the terminal run of Skeena Chinook point estimate is 26,615 with a 50% confidence interval of 16,683 (p25) to 34,747 (p75).\n\nTyee Test Fishery\n\nThe Tyee test fishery started operations on June 10.\nSockeye escapement estimates are tracking just above the median of returns from 1970-2024, with the TRTC model estimate increasing over the last few days, but still well below the pre-season forecast for early and average run-timing projections.\nChinook are also being caught at Tyee, with the cumulative index increasing to between the 25th and 50th percentiles to date. Compared to recent years (2011 on), the Chinook index is looking quite good.\nFew pink, coho, chum, or steelhead have been caught at Tyee yet, however supporting information indicates that some coho have been caught in FSC fisheries.\n\nBabine\n\nThe Babine fence typically starts operations in mid-July. This section will be updated once Babine counts start.\nBabine vs Tyee comparison will be added when fence operations start.\nBabine jack sockeye to be updated soon!\nBabine other salmon to be updated soon!\n\nKitwanga Fence\n\nThe Kitwanga fence typically starts operations by July 10. Information from the Kitwanga fence is shared weekly by Gitanyow Fisheries Authority.\n\nFirst Nations Food Fisheries\n\nFirst Nations food fisheries have started on the coast and marine approach waters, and in-river.\nIndications suggest that fishing in-river has been slow so far.\n\nCommercial Fisheries\n\nCommercial fisheries in Area 4 targeting sockeye have not started yet, but are anticipated given the pre-season sockeye forecast.\nCommercial fisheries targeting sockeye will open in Area 3 on July 2 and 3.\n\nRecreational Fisheries\n\nRecreational fisheries for sockeye have not started, but will begin once the in-season forecast exceeds 1.05M and commercial fishery openings are triggered in Area 4.\nEarly recreational fisheries for Chinook occurred in Areas 3/4 however effort was lower in 2025 than in previous years, bag limits were reduced, and as of June 22 there is non-retention of Chinook in the Area 3&4 fishery.\n\nAppendix A shows the daily and cumulative run-timing of Tyee since 2000 versus 2024.\nAppendix B will include information on the other species caught in the Area 4 commercial fishery and CPUEs and will be updated once fisheries begin.\nAppendix C includes information on run-timing of specific Skeena Conservation Units/stocks.",
