    "text": "Pre-season forecasts\n\nThe pre-season forecast for the Total Return of Skeena sockeye in 2025 ranges from 1.3 to 5.8 million (90% confidence range) with a point estimate (p50) of 2.7 million.\nOn average, Alaskan fisheries take approximately 5-10% of the aggregate sockeye run.\nThe pre-season forecast for the terminal run of Skeena Chinook point estimate is 26,615 with a 50% confidence interval of 16,683 (p25) to 34,747 (p75).\n\nTyee Test Fishery\n\nThe Tyee test fishery started operations on June 10.\nMoving towards larger tides which may improve fish movement.\nSockeye escapement estimates are tracking just below the median of returns from 1970-2024, with the TRTC model estimate stabilising over the last 2 weeks while decreasing slightly to around 1.68M on average timing (1.77M if one week late, and 1.63M if one week early), but still well below the pre-season forecast for early and average run-timing projections.\nIf average run-timing, ~ 95% of the run has passed Tyee to date.\nThe Chinook index index is tracking between the 25th and 50th percentiles of all years to date. Compared to recent years (2011 on), the Chinook index is looking quite good tracking between the 50th and 75th percentiles.\nPink salmon were tracking off the charts well above the highest run index ever. Supporting information from Area 3 and other fisheries indicates a very large pink return this year, however decreasing index values may indicate a very early pink run this year.\nChum and coho are tracking around the long-term median to date.\nSteelhead started fairly stong, but are now tracking jsut below the long-term median.\n\nBabine\n\nThe Babine fence typically started operations on July 14.\nLarge sockeye are tracking around the 75th percentile to date.\nIn comparison to Tyee, the Babine fence is showing less sockeye so far than expected, which could be a result of a Tyee overestimate, longer than expected migration between Tyee and the Babine fence, or a grearter proportion of non-Babine sockeye than 10% this year.\nJack sockeye, which predict 4-yr old sockeye returns next year, are tracking right around the long-term median.\nPink salmon have also started showing up at the Babine fence, and are also indicating an early return there.\n\nKitwanga Fence\n\nThe Kitwanga fence typically started operations on July 11. Information from the Kitwanga fence is shared weekly by Gitanyow Fisheries Authority.\n\nFirst Nations Food Fisheries\n\nFirst Nations food fisheries are ongoing on the coast and marine approach waters, and in-river.\n\nCommercial Fisheries\n\nCommercial fisheries targetting sockeye in Area 4 started on July 12 and the last commercial opportunity was August 4-7 for seines, and August 8 for gillnets.\nFirst Nations demonstration fisheries targeting sockeye in Area 4 opened on July 9 for Lax Kw’alaams, Metlakatla and NCSFNSS.\nIn-river demo fisheries are ongoing, with openings for Kitsumkalum, Kitselas, and Gitksan to date.\nCatch information for demo fisheries has been updated and will be updated with preliminary information as it comes in.\n\nRecreational Fisheries\n\nRecreational fisheries for sockeye have opened following the IFMP and the commercial opening for sockeye.\nEarly recreational fisheries for Chinook occurred in Areas 3/4 however effort was lower in 2025 than in previous years, bag limits were reduced, and as of June 22 there was non-retention of Chinook in the Area 3&4 fishery.\nRetention of Chinook in Areas 3-5 resumed July 24 with a daily limit of 1 per day.\n\nAppendix A shows the daily and cumulative run-timing of Tyee since 2000 versus 2024.\nAppendix B will include information on the other species caught in the Area 4 commercial fishery and CPUEs and will be updated once fisheries begin.\nAppendix C includes information on run-timing of specific Skeena Conservation Units/stocks.",
