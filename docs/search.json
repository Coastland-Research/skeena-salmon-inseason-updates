    "text": "Summary\n\nCumulative total escapement of 1,122,420 past Tyee to date (Table 1, Figure 1). Run would be about 52% through on late timing, 72% on average timing, and 85% if the run is early. Estimated TRTC is ~ 1.339M although this does not include marine FSC catch.\nContinued low daily Tyee estimates and catches in the marine fishery are concerning, with indications for a potentially early, and lower than expected run (Figure 2). Well below average daily estimates through Tyee.\nNow after peak (on average timing), however the simple Tyee run-timing model estimate continues to fall with the below average daily counts, suggesting runs of ~ 1.85M (average run-timing), 1.6M (early run-timing), 2.4M (late run-timing) (Figure 3).\nBabine fence is operational with 192,702 large sockeye estimated through to date (and 4,167 jacks) (Figure 4, Figure 6). Some early sockeye were missed due to delay in opening from wildfires.\nTyee comparison with Babine fence counts (Figure 5) is very early, although some indications that fish are missing from the Babine fence. This is likely mostly missed fish before the fence was operational. Low Skeena discharge may be making migration timing faster than usual, which would have the opposite effect. A coarse estimate of in-rover FSC and demo catches when they occur are included in the comparison.\nMarine and in-river sockeye Section 35(1) fisheries ongoing.\nArea 4 commercial gillnet fishery last opening was July 31/August 1, seines completed their second opening, and FNs marine demo fisheries were open again last week and are open again this week with small allocations. Total gillnet and seine catch to date ~ 235k. Total marine demo catch ~11,013 but missing some catch numbers (Table 4, Figure 9).\nRecreational fishing trigger of 1,000,000 has been passed triggering sockeye directed recreational fisheries with a daily limit of 2 on the Skeena, Babine River and Babine Lake. The next trigger (1.0M) likely to be exceeded shortly. Retention of 4 sockeye daily opening on July 25 in Areas 3-5 (marine). LBN has closed Babine River near fence to recreational angling. Marine areas 3-5 are open to sockeye with daily limit of 4.\nAppendix A includes information on the other species caught in the Area 4 commercial fishery and CPUEs.\nAppendix B includes information on run-timing of specific Skeena Conservation Units/stocks.\n\n\n\n\nTyee Escapement and TRTC\n\nCumulative escapement, TRTC, and catch to August 1.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCumulative.to.Date\nNumber.of.Sockeye\nRun.Timing\nPercent.Through\n\n\n\n\nEscapement Past Tyee\n1122420\nAverage\n71.8\n\n\nTRTC (Escapement+Catch)\n1339288\nOne week early\n85.3\n\n\nCatch (preliminary)\n235600\nOne week late\n52.4\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDaily (top) and cumulative (bottom) estimated escapement and TRTC (escapement + adjusted catch) at the Tyee test fishery versus the 1985-2021 average.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCumulative estimated daily proportion of TRTC based on 1985-2021 average.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTyee run-timing model\n\nForecasted sockeye final TRTC based on early, average and late run-timing.\n\n\nRun.Timing\nForecasted.Final.Run.Size\n\n\n\n\nEarly\n1599769\n\n\nAverage\n1866154\n\n\nLate\n2418439\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nForecasted final TRTC of Skeena sockeye based on the simple scalar run-timing model.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBabine Fence\n\n\nCumulative large sockeye and jacks to Babine River fence to August 1.\n\n\nBabine.Fence\nTotal.Run\n\n\n\n\nLarge Sockeye\n192702\n\n\nJacks\n4167\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTop panel: Total run to Babine fence for 2023 compared to 2022 (recent highest year) and the average from 2011-2021.

The red line in the figure below shows the difference between the escapement past Tyee and the total run being counted at the Babine Fence, based on some assumptions. These assumptions include 3 week migration timing, 10% non-Babine stock composition and a rough estimate of in-river FSC and demo harvest to date between Tyee and Babine. In 2023 some sockeye were missed due to the delay from wildfire evacuations, however DFO and LBN staff indicate that no sockeye were visible below the fence when it was evacuated, and therefore the number of sockeye missed was probably fairly low. Additional analysis will be required to provide an estimate of the number of missed sockeye.\n\n\nWarning: Removed 342 rows containing missing values (`geom_line()`).\n\n\n\n\n\nEstimated difference in sockeye between escapement past Tyee and the Babine Fence based on 3 week migration timing, 10% non-Babine stocks, and in-river FSC and demo catch to date.
