    "text": "Summary\n\nThe pre-season forecast for the Total Return of Skeena sockeye in 2024 ranges from 0.58 to 4.0 million (90% confidence range) with a point estimate (p50) of 1.54 million.\nThe forecast for 2024 includes a low return of age-4 sockeye, and an average return of age-5 sockeye.\nThe Tyee test fishery started on June 10.\nTo date 25,843 sockeye are estimated to have passed by Tyee, with about 2.7% of the run through to date on average (0.9% if 1-week late, 6.8% if one week early).\nIt is too early to use the run timing to predict a final 2024 return of sockeye, however the 2024 return despite an early bump is tracking similar to 2020 and 2021, and well below average (Figures 1-3).\nIf sockeye return at the pre-season forecasted abundance, a small commercial fishery will be able to be prosecuted (both Area C and demo).\nAppendix A will include information on the other species caught in the Area 4 commercial fishery and CPUEs when available.\nAppendix B includes information on run-timing of specific Skeena Conservation Units/stocks.\n\n\n\nTyee Escapement and TRTC\n\nCumulative escapement, TRTC, and catch to June 27.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCumulative.to.Date\nNumber.of.Sockeye\nRun.Timing\nPercent.Through\n\n\n\n\nEscapement Past Tyee\n25843\nAverage\n2.7\n\n\nTRTC (Escapement+Catch)\n25843\nOne week early\n6.8\n\n\nCatch (preliminary)\n0\nOne week late\n0.9\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Daily (top) and cumulative (bottom) estimated escapement and TRTC (escapement + adjusted catch) at the Tyee test fishery versus the 1985-2023 average.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2: Daily run through Tyee (uncorrected) from 1970-2023. 2024 run is shown in purple.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3: Daily run through Tyee (uncorrected) since 2020. 2024 run is shown in purple.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTyee run-timing model\n\nForecasted sockeye final TRTC based on early, average and late run-timing.\n\n\nRun.Timing\nForecasted.Final.Run.Size\n\n\n\n\nEarly\n436696\n\n\nAverage\n955965\n\n\nLate\n2461893\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4: Forecasted final TRTC of Skeena sockeye based on the simple scalar run-timing model.
