    "text": "Pre-season forecast\n\nThe pre-season forecast for the Total Return of Skeena sockeye in 2024 ranges from 0.58 to 4.0 million (90% confidence range) with a point estimate (p50) of 1.54 million. The forecast for 2024 includes a low return of age-4 sockeye, and an average return of age-5 sockeye.\n\nTyee Test Fishery\n\nTides influence the migration of salmon into the Skeena River.\nTo date &gt; 1.7M sockeye are estimated to have passed by Tyee, with about 98% of the run through to date on average (95% if 1-week late, 99% if one week early). Daily sockeye counts have dropped and are now very low (Figures 1-5). Including commercial catch and First Nations marine catches, the TRTC estimate is around 1.95M with about 200,000 marine commercial catch between Area C, Area A and First Nations Demo/EO fisheries.\nThe excel model increased in early July, stabilized briefly, decreased significantly, and stabilized again, declined slowly, and since has stabilized again although slowly declining. The 3 lines are converging as is normal this time of year and this also supports average timing of the run.\nThe current run size prediction is 1.93M on average run-timing (2M if one week late and 1.9M if 1 week early) (Figure 6). These should not change much anymore through the remainder of the run.\nThe Chinook index remains very low and available evidence suggests a very low run and is tracking near the 10th percentile (Figure 7).\nThe chum salmon index is currently lower than average around the 25th percentile (Figure 8).\nPink salmon are looking strong this year relative to even-year abundance with the index tracking between the 75th and 90th percentiles (Figure 9).\nCoho salmon are passing through Tyee and tracking just under the long term average (Figure 10).\nThe Steelhead index suggests a strong run is continuing, although declining slightly to near the 75th percentile of returns. The latest Province of BC update estimates around 32,088 Steelhead through Tyee to date (as of August 22) (Figure 11).\n\nBabine Fence\n\nThe Babine River fence started operations on July 9th. The total large sockeye run to date has just officially passed 2 million, with recent large return days bumping the run over the recent and historical averages, and exceeding 2023, with relatively strong days continuing (Figures 12-14).\n\nBabine versus Tyee comparison\n\nFigure 15 shows the expected difference between the escapement past Tyee and the number of sockeye showing up at the Babine fence. This includes the in-river catch and an adjustment assuming that 10% of the sockeye passing Tyee are non-Babine.\nThe comparison showed some delay in migration at the start of the run, followed by the Babine fence tracking the expected run at 3 weeks migration timing quite closely, however the comparison now shows that there are many more fish arriving at Babine than expected. This indicates an underestimate in the number of sockeye passing through Tyee 3 weeks prior and/or possibly a smaller proportion of non-Babine sockeye.\n\nBabine Jack sockeye\n\nThe total run of jack sockeye to date is now over 101k, well above the longer term and recent averages (Figures 16-17).\n\nBabine other salmon\n\nFigures (18-21) show the returns of species other than sockeye to the Babine fence versus historical averages.\n\nKitwanga Fence\n\nThe Kitwanga fence started operations July 10.\nDetails on the Kitwanga fence counts can be found at the Gitanyow Fisheries Authority website.\n\nCommercial Fisheries\n\nCommercial fishing has started, with Area C gillnet openings on July 13, 20-21, 25-26, 29-30, August 2-3 and 8-9. The Area A seine fishery was open July 25-28 and August 2-5. Coastal Demonstration Fisheries opened on July 16, 21, 24, 27-28, July 31-August 2, August 4-7 and 11. In-river demonstration fisheries started July 30 for the Gitksan and August 15 for LBN. An ESSR fishery at Fulton River targeting sockeye on August 23 for the Lake Babine Nation. There was also an ESSR fishery targeting pink salmon at Witset.\nPreliminary sockeye catch in the Area C gillnet openings is ~ 132,000. Preliminary sockeye catch in the Area A seine fisheries is ~ 46,000. Preliminary demonstration fishery catches are over likely near 50,000 sockeye and split between the coast and in-river. Late timed commercial marine openings had low effort and low catch rates.\nMore details on catch can be found in the catch section below and in Appendix B.\n\nRecreational Fisheries\n\nRecreational fisheries openings and fisheries notices for the Skeena are shown in the Table of Fisheries openings.\nCurrent regulations for Region 6 (Skeena) can be found on DFO’s website here.\n\nAppendix A shows the daily and cumulative run-timing of Tyee since 2000 versus 2024.\nAppendix B will include information on the other species caught in the Area 4 commercial fishery and CPUEs and will be updated shortly.\nAppendix C includes information on run-timing of specific Skeena Conservation Units/stocks.",

The 2024 run estimates are shown by the coloured lines. Each line represents the proportion through based on a final season estimate shown in the legend. For example, the red line is based on a final TRTC of 1.5M, with the line showing the cumulative number of sockeye through on each date / 1.5M. Until we have the true final TRTC, we will not be able to calculate the true cumulative proportion. This is done to give an idea of run-timing and whether the pre-season forecast is likely to be close to the in-season estimate.

This figure shows how the run in 2024 compares with recent years in terms of the Tyee daily estimates (note this does not include catch estimates in the marine commercial or Section 35(1) fisheries). These estimates are raw data from Tyee and therefore not corrected for catchability.\nCurrently, daily run estimates are tracking close to 2023, and considerably higher than 2020 and 2021.

Accuracy of this model increases as the season progresses since run-timing uncertainty is large at the start of the year, and small at the end of the year. Catchability (how many sockeye each sockeye caught in the Tyee test fishery represents), the other component of the uncertainty in this model, is unknown until after the final TRTC accounting has been completed in the post-season. Tyee estimates typically have a range of +/- 20% from the true TRTC, with some years being greater than 20% error, and many years being less than 20% error. The 2024 catchability is based on an average of the last 3 years.\n\nForecasted sockeye final TRTC based on 1 week early, average and 1 week late run-timing.\n\n\nRun.Timing\nForecasted.Final.Run.Size\n\n\n\n\nEarly\n1912190\n\n\nAverage\n1924587\n\n\nLate\n1954266\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 6: Forecasted final TRTC of Skeena sockeye based on the simple scalar run-timing model.
